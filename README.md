# Famine Prediction open source models

An open-source repository for modeling famine.

Warning! - for now there are no experts involved, just some curiosity and a desire to make the data and models more transparent. The current focus is to model the famine in Sudan.

## Start here

For now, we provide some simple notebooks to illustrate the basic calculations:
1) a simple walk through of calculating calories available in 2023-2024 in `notebooks/est_kcal_walkthrough.ipynb` 
Or [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/aristotle-tek/famine-prediction/blob/main/notebooks/est_kcal_walkthrough.ipynb)
For a more narrative overview, see a discussion of this material in the [blog post here](https://theoryandaction.substack.com/p/transparent-famine-models-i-counting).

2) An overview of the basic calculations for caloric deficit, changes in BMI, and excess mortality in `notebooks/fundamentals_walkthrough.ipynb` 
Or [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/aristotle-tek/famine-prediction/blob/main/notebooks/fundamentals_walkthrough.ipynb)
For a more narrative overview, see a discussion of this material in the [blog post here](https://theoryandaction.substack.com/p/transparent-famine-models-ii).

2) A (draft) overview of the resource scarcity model (combining the above with monthly predictions) in `notebooks/scarcity_model_walkthrough.ipynb` 
Or [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/aristotle-tek/famine-prediction/blob/main/notebooks/scarcity_model_walkthrough.ipynb)
