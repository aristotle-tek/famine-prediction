    "Warning: I am not an expert! This is just a rough 'back of the napkin' calculation. The idea is to see if we can calculate approximately how many calories (kcal) of food are available in Sudan between September 2023 and September 2024. The approach is based on my best reconstruction from what I read in the Clingendael reports and some limited personal correspondence with someone in the field. If you find problems or have suggestions for improvement, please let me know!\n",
