### FAO - GIEWS – Global Information and Early Warning System on Food and Agriculture

Baquedano 2015 [Developing an indicator of price anomalies as an early warning tool: A compound growth approach](https://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/foodprice/docs/resources/a-i7550e.pdf)
- case studies - Millet in Niger and red beans in Nicaragua.

"the indicator of price anomalies mainly informs the Food Price Monitoring and Analysis website and bulletin, published on monthly intervals by the FAO/GIEWS. Validation of the signals generated by the
indicator of price anomalies is undertaken by weighing market fundamentals (production, trade, stocks) and local market/policy conditions. At times, even if a price warning is given by the indicator, it is not always considered, for example an alert is generated but in the month where the harvest is undergoing and the expectations for production are very good."

### Sending out an SOS: using start of rainy season indicators for market price forecasting to support famine early warning
2021. Environmental Research Letters, Volume 16, Number 8.
https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac15cc/meta


" we examine if SOS indicators can predict price means over 6 and 9 month periods, or roughly the length of time from planting to market...We find that using some form of SOS indicator (either an SOS anomaly or 1st month's rainfall anomaly) leads to increased predictive power when examining prices over a 6 months window. However, the results vary considerably by country. "

[WB Policy Research Working Paper 9413](https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/911801600788869914/stochastic-modeling-of-food-insecurity)
"develops a predictive, statistical framework to identify drivers of food insecurity risk with simulation capabilities for scenario analyses, risk assessment and forecasting purposes. It utilizes a panel vector-autoregression to model food insecurity distributions of 15 Sub-Saharan African countries between October 2009 and February 2019...Conflict variables are more relevant for dynamics in highly critical stages, while agronomic and weather variables are more important for less critical states. Food prices are predictive for all cases."

### FEWS evaluation and warning system critiques

- [Validating Famine Early Warning Systems Network projections of food security in Africa, 2009–2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211912421000201)

"""
• Overall accuracy of FEWS NET projections of food security in Africa is 84 percent
• Accuracy drops with tendencies toward over-projection of severe food insecurity
• Intervening humanitarian assistance contributes to explanation for over-projections
• Unanticipated climate and conflict shocks also hinder the accuracy of projections
"""

[Real-Time Decision Support Systems: The Famine Early Warning System Network](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-90-481-2915-7_17)
"...we focus on some of FEWS NET’s hydrologic monitoring tools, with a specific emphasis on combining “low frequency” and “high frequency” assessment tools. Low frequency assessment tools, tied to water and food balance estimates, enable us to evaluate and map long-term tendencies in food security. High frequency assessments are supported by agrohydrologic models driven by satellite rainfall estimates, such as the Water Requirement Satisfaction Index (WRSI). Focusing on eastern Africa, we suggest that both these high and low frequency approaches are necessary to capture the interaction of slow variations in vulnerability and the relatively rapid onset of climatic shocks."


Maxwell. 2019. [Famine Early Warning and Information Systems in Conflict Settings: Challenges for Humanitarian Metrics and Response](https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/102836/1/Maxwell_famine_early_warning_and_information_systems_published.pdf)



- Quero, et al. [Improving famine early warning systems: a conflict-sensitive approach](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14678802.2023.2188570)

"The existing information mechanisms on food insecurity are not ‘conflict sensitive’, that is, they do not sufficiently incorporate the causal relation between conflict and hunger. This generates a lack of detailed information in this respect, which hinders implementation of Security Council Resolution 2417."

## Case studies

- [A Bayesian Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Markets During the Finnish 1860s Famine](https://academic.oup.com/jrsssc/article-abstract/71/5/1282/7073273)

"we detected spatially asymmetric ‘price ripples’ that spread out from the shock origin. We corroborated the existing literature on the speedier adjustment to emerging price differentials during the famine, but we observed this principally in urban markets. This hastened return to long-run equilibrium means faster and longer travel of price shocks, implying prolonged out-of-equilibrium dynamics, proliferated influence of market shocks, and, importantly, a wider spread of famine conditions."
