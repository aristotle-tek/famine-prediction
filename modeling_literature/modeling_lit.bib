  abstract = {We develop a Bayesian spatio-temporal model to study pre-industrial grain market integration during the Finnish famine of the 1860s. Our model takes into account several problematic features often present when analysing multiple spatially interdependent time series. For example, compared with the error correction methodology commonly applied in econometrics, our approach allows simultaneous modelling of multiple interdependent time series avoiding cumbersome statistical testing needed to predetermine the market leader as a point of reference. Furthermore, introducing a flexible spatio-temporal structure enables analysing detailed regional and temporal dynamics of the market mechanisms. Applying the proposed method, we detected spatially asymmetric `price ripples' that spread out from the shock origin. We corroborated the existing literature on the speedier adjustment to emerging price differentials during the famine, but we observed this principally in urban markets. This hastened return to long-run equilibrium means faster and longer travel of price shocks, implying prolonged out-of-equilibrium dynamics, proliferated influence of market shocks, and, importantly, a wider spread of famine conditions.},

  abstract = {We examine relationships between the start of rainy season (SOS) and sub-national grain (white maize) market price movements in five African countries. Our work is motivated by three factors: (a) some regions are seeing increasing volatility SOS timing; (b) SOS represents the first observable occurrence in the agricultural season and starts a chain reaction of decisions that influence planting, labor allocation, and harvest---all of which can have direct impacts on local food prices and availability; and (c) pre- and post-harvest price movements provide key insights into supply-and-demand issues related to food insecurity. We start by exploring a number of different SOS definitions using varying reference periods to define whether an SOS is `on-time' or `late'. We then compare how those different definitions perform in seasonal price forecasting models. Specifically, we examine if SOS indicators can predict price means over 6 and 9 month periods, or roughly the length of time from planting to market. We use different reference periods for defining `early' versus `late' seasonal starts based on the previous year's start date, or median start dates over the past 3, 5, and 10 year periods. We then compare the out-of-sample forecast performance of univariate time-series models (autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)) with time-series (ARIMAX) models that include various SOS definitions as exogenous predictors. We find that using some form of SOS indicator (either an SOS anomaly or 1st month's rainfall anomaly) leads to increased predictive power when examining prices over a 6 months window. However, the results vary considerably by country. We find the strongest performance of SOS indicators in central Ethiopia, southern Kenya, and southern Somalia. We find less evidence in support of the use of SOS indicators for price forecasting in Malawi and Mozambique.},

FEWS NET supports and informs disaster relief decisions that impact millions of people and involve billions of dollars. In this chapter, we focus on some of FEWS NET's hydrologic monitoring tools, with a specific emphasis on combining ``low frequency'' and ``high frequency'' assessment tools. Low frequency assessment tools, tied to water and food balance estimates, enable us to evaluate and map long-term tendencies in food security. High frequency assessments are supported by agrohydrologic models driven by satellite rainfall estimates, such as the Water Requirement Satisfaction Index (WRSI). Focusing on eastern Africa, we suggest that both these high and low frequency approaches are necessary to capture the interaction of slow variations in vulnerability and the relatively rapid onset of climatic shocks.},

This generates a lack of detailed information in this respect, which hinders implementation of Security Council Resolution 2417. It is therefore necessary to advance towards an early warning system that considers the impact of the use of hunger as a weapon of war on the different dimensions of food security, and is capable of collecting empirical evidence at the local level in a regular and agile form. To that end, in this article we reflect on the existing difficulties in collecting and analysing such information, and propose theoretical and operational inputs for constructing conflict-sensitive early warning systems in contexts of acute food insecurity.},

Females appear to be able to withstand starvation to much lower values of BMI compared to males. This may be partly due to the the greater amount of adipose tissue in women and the preferential use of fat rather than lean tissue as fuel during starvation. These gender-specific fuel mobilisation patterns during starvation may provide evolutionary advantages to the females.},
